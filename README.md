## The Data Visualization
1. I found this visualization by going onto the New York Times webpage and searching for COVID data. This image surprised me since I have only seen vaccine rate visualizations regarding the states before but never the entire globe. *The conclusions I made were concerning*. Furthermore, I picked this visualization related to COVID since a close family member of mine passed in the ICU due to COVID. This date visualization was created by Josh Holder, a researcher and writer for the New York Times. The map of data was last updated on September 4th, 2022. You can find the visualization using this following link: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/covid-vaccinations-tracker.html

2. The visualization is a global map that uses color from light red to green showing the percentage of civilians in each country that have been vaccinated. Green being 100% and red being 0%. Overall, about 70% of the global population have received at least one dose of a COVID vaccine. However, the map shows a huge gap in vaccine rates between regions. For example, **only about 30% of people living in the continent of Africa have received at least one dose**, while most other parts of the world's civilians have been 60-70% vaccinated. ***This could indicate poor vaccine supply and programs in the region.***

## Quick Facts

+ **Who**: The visualization was created by Josh Holder for the New York Times using government reports from each country.
+ **Date**: The map was published on January 29th, 2021 and last updated on September 4th, 2022.
+ **Stakeholders**: The audience for the visualization are civilians interested in tracking the progress of COVID countermeasures. Peoples beliefs may be altered by the visualization as more people may sympathize with parts of the world that aren't progressing as well as other countries like the US is. People may be more inclined to give and donate to those parts of the world like countries in Africa for example.
+ **Interests**: I believe the New York Times wanted to raise awareness about how the vaccine rates vastly differ from regions and raise the question of whether or not the first world should assist in the vaccine progress in the third world, specifically African countries.
+ **Key fact**: Roughly 5.35 billion people in the world have been vaccinated with the vast majority living in China and the first world.

## Data Feminism: What I Learned?
>a way of thinking about data, both their uses and their limits, that is informed by direct experience, by a commitment to action, and by intersectional feminist thought

My understanding of data feminism is that it is a way of thinking about data science and the ethics of it through lens of feminism.

A couple issues related to the data visualization map arise when thinking thoroughly of it. One example is the accuracy of the government reports that Josh Holder used for the data visualization. There are some governments that may falsify their reports to seem more successful. Another issue is how African countries can obtain vaccines to distribute among their population. Many don't have health laboratories that are capable of developing such. This makes many countries have to rely on other countries like the US for example. Also many hospitals 	:hospital: don't have the necessary resources to make a robust vaccine program.
